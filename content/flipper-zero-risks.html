<h2>What is the Flipper Zero?</h2>
<p>The Flipper Zero is a small, versatile device that looks like a toy but packs a powerful suite of tools for interacting with a wide range of wireless and hardware protocols. It combines an RFID reader/writer, a radio transceiver for Sub-GHz frequencies, an infrared transceiver, and GPIO pins for direct hardware interaction. It was designed for penetration testers and hardware hobbyists to experiment with and audit digital and physical access controls.</p>

<h2>The Risks</h2>
<p>While an invaluable tool for security professionals, the Flipper Zero's ease of use and broad capabilities introduce several risks:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>RFID Skimming:</strong> It can read, save, and emulate RFID cards. This includes access badges for buildings, ski passes, and potentially even older credit cards, allowing for unauthorized cloning.</li>
    <li><strong>Replay Attacks:</strong> The Sub-GHz radio can capture signals from key fobs (for cars and garages), remote controls, and wireless doorbells. By replaying these signals, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access.</li>
    <li><strong>BadUSB / HID Attacks:</strong> When plugged into a computer via USB, the Flipper Zero can emulate a keyboard and execute pre-programmed scripts at superhuman speed. This could be used to install malware, exfiltrate data, or take control of a system in seconds.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrared Exploits:</strong> The infrared module can be used to control a vast array of devices, from TVs and air conditioners to more sensitive industrial equipment, potentially causing disruption or damage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why You Should Be Aware</h2>
<p>The democratization of powerful hacking tools means that physical and digital security can no longer be taken for granted. The Flipper Zero highlights the vulnerabilities in everyday systems that rely on outdated or insecure protocols. It serves as a stark reminder that if a dedicated hobbyist can bypass a security system, a determined attacker certainly can.</p>
<p>Being aware of these tools and their capabilities is the first step towards better security hygiene. It encourages us to ask for stronger encryption, multi-factor authentication, and more robust access control systems in the products and services we use daily.</p>
